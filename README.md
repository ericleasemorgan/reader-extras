# Distant Reader Toolbox

The Distant Reader Toolbox is a suite of software designed to assist the student, researcher, or scholar in getting the most out of their collection of Distant Reader study carrels. The suite includes both command-line scripts and Web front-ends to locally cached study carrels so the carrels' use &amp; understanding can be increased -- a form of reading.

The use of the Toolbox requires zero programming skills, but the student, researcher, or scholar almost certainly must be willing to execute commands from the command-line. This process is not difficult. It merely requires practice. Remember, computers are stupid. Despite the current hype surrounding artificial "intelligence" and "machine learning", computers only do what you tell them to do, and that is the way it should be.
